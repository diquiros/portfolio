              <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
       <h2> <p>I intended to become a artist who did animation and create my own character designs; things changed.
      As someone who grew up playing video games most of the time, I created fond memories of these inspiring stories making it obvious to choose art as a major.
          I knew that video is a story in itself as it guided the viewer through sections creating memories that stay with you.</p>
          As a huge advocate for video art I wanted to develop storytelling through new media such as video games and video. Video games along with video art allows the audience experience new media in a way using contemporary art in media to express an artistâ€™s view in the digital age.
          My ultimate goal is to have people see video art and video games as the future since I believe storytelling and immersion of emotion is powerful in ways physical art cannot achieve. I want to be the person who can tell a story with these tools, which is why I am here to tell my stories through my mediums.

     Uitilizing moviemaker, I edited multiple clips taken together
  and borrowed video clips that empower my passion and creativity through a narrative video. It
lets me declare my passion of storytelling and show my strength as a DMA major with this video called Genesis 5.

Using Premiere Pro as a tool, I was able to develop "Four Horseman" which would be used in a art gallery installation. I used the concept of death, pestilence,war, and famine to represent them in video using unique transtions/effects.

 With my tesselation projec, I put together a documentation of our laser cut wood through Premiere Pro to repesent the nothces and connections. I am able to remind myself as to how a project is to be presented using music and camera angle to have a clear view of materials.
